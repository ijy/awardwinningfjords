[Break an image into columns, which animate along with the camera]: /projects/webgl-prototypes/columns.html
[Map an image to cloth, double-click to fold]: /projects/webgl-prototypes/cloth-blinds.html
[Map an image to cloth, blow it around with wind]: /projects/webgl-prototypes/cloth-wind.html
[Map an image to cloth, drag the bottom-center with the mouse]: /projects/webgl-prototypes/cloth-drag.html

For posterity, here are a couple prototypes I put together to see if WebGL was appropriate for a recent project (more on this later).
