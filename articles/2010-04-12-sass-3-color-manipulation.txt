I was going to write about the Compass Colors plugin merging into Sass 3, but it looks like Sass-maintainer Nathan Weizenbaum has already written a great article about it.

Read about [Powerful Color Manipulation with Sass] on his blog.

Just for kicks, here is a relavant portion of Sass colors that I use on this blog:

    $font_color:         darken(#4e4c49, 5)
    $darker_font_color:  #4e4c49
    $header_color:       darken($font_color, 10)
    $border_color:       #d0d0d0
    $link_color:         #af512c
          
    #social
      color: lighten($font-color, 40)
      
    #footer
      background: darken(#603d17, 5)
    
These functions are also used in [Brandon Mathis' fantastic Fancy Button library]. Brandon and [Susy's] Eric Meyer are both [Compass core contributors] now. Congratulations to both and thanks for all the fantastic code.
