title: "Don't Fork"

What makes an Open Source project great? Is it simply the fact that you're getting code for free? If that were true, then SourceForge and `code.google.com` wouldn't be ghost towns.

What makes a project great is the community. The larger and more active the community, the more likely it is that your project has already been solved, discussed on StackExchange or the particular bug reported. The age of the project and community matter. With age comes an institutional knowledge base and a backlog of closed bugs to reference. Older projects have learned how important documentation is and why the primary goal of a new release is to avoid breaking things for current users.

These are hard lessons, the equivalent of growing up for the Open Source world. Once upon a time, I forked. [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) started as a fork of StaticMatic. I felt development of the original was slowing, so I kept customizing my copy of StaticMatic until it was different enough to deserve its own name.

It took a couple years, but eventually Middleman became popular in its own right. StaticMatic development ended and the original maintain directed his users towards Middleman. A happy-ish story in the end.

But you know what I should have done? I should have contributed to StaticMatic. I should have brought my time and ideas to the existing community and improved it. In forking, I had to relearn lessons already learned and in the time it took me to learn (and decide documentation was important) a lot of users spent a lot of time frustrated with my project.

## Forking is a Responsibility









Github has taken the word "fork" and made it a much more positive idea. Github forks are contributors, future pull-requests waiting to improve the source repository. But I want to talk about the original "fork". The "I'm taking my ball and going home" fork.
