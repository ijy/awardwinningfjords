Two big announcements today.

First, I'll be speaking at [jQuery Conference: Boston 2010] which is taking place October 16-17. My talk will be on code organization and dependency management with [JavascriptMVC 3] and [steal] being the two solutions that I'm most fond of.

Second, I've joined the JavascriptMVC Core Team, so I can actually appear to be an authority on the subject I'm presenting :)

Thanks to the jQuery Conference organizers for accepting my talk and thanks to [Justin Meyer] and the rest of the JavascriptMVC Core Team for having me. See you all in Boston!
