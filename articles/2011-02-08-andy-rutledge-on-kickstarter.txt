> By taking the professional-to-client approach for what should be a merchant-to-customer context, Mr. Chimero has abdicated ownership of his idea/genius and the results that will come of it. Having bought and paid for it, the collective investors now own his genius in this project. By selling out first before he created the product he promises, heâ€™s now working for the investors instead of working for himself.<br />

[Read the full article], it's great.

I've been feeling some serious discomfort as Kickstarter has gained popularity. On one hand, I feel a certain amount of jealousy towards people who are able to trade popularity for money, rather than actual work. I spend my professional time building products which I exchange for cold hard cash. In my free time, I dream of building products for myself that I could sell directly, but it's time-consuming, pays nothing upfront and I am my own harshest critic (bug reporter). So the idea that people are being paid tens of thousands of dollars to work on their own project before they've even started, makes me pretty jealous. My cards are on the table.

I should also mention that I'm adverse to all the "cash up front" systems. Venture Capital, book deals, buying a house. It all freaks me out a little. Too much wiggle room and a chance for one side to get taken advantage of when you move away from "I give you something for money."

End rant. I'm sure I'll re-read this article in a couple years and feel like a fool.
