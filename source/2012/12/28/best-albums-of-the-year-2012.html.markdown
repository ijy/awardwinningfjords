title: "Best Albums of the Year: 2012"
---

I think I'm getting old. Last year I only had 7 albums I like, this year is even worse. I listened to a lot of Leonard Cohen and Hall & Oates this year :-p

**Honorable Mentions:** Japandroids, Regina Spektor, Between the Buried and Me, Dethklok, Killer Mike.

**Disappointments:** Say Anything, Tenacious D, mewithoutYou, The Mars Volta.

**Sad Truth:** My favorite song this year was actually Call Me Maybe. That is not a joke.

## Top 5:

      <h6>P.O.S.</h6>
      <h4>We Don't Even Live Here</h4>
      <p>Probably my favorite rapper exchanges the punk-y guitars on his last album for darker sounds and dancier beats. Future classic.</p>

      <h6>Fang Island</h6>
      <h4>Major</h4>
      <p>Fang Island lost a guitar, calmed down a bit, but managed to put out a really fun and cohesive album.</p>

      <h6>Coheed and Cambria</h6>
      <h4>The Afterman: Ascension</h4>
      <p>I was kind of sad Coheed ended their 5-part space opera with the wimper that was Year of the Black Rainbow. Thankfully, they've decided not to call it quits and have come back with a double-album, Ascension being the first part. Other than "Key Entity Extraction I: Domino the Destitute", I wasn't immediately blown away, but I've been coming back to the album over and over; loving it more with each listen.</p>

      <h6>Fun.</h6>
      <h4>Some Nights</h4>
      <p>I saw This Past Year in a basement in Mesa, AZ something like 12 years ago. Can't believe it took the world so long to discover Nate Ruess, but I'm happy for those guys that they finally blew up.</p>
      <p>Some Nights is basically Dog Problems with a bigger budget and even more self-confidence. It's huge, eclectic and reminds me a lot of Queen in the best possible ways.</p>
