Maybe we've all been too hasty in declaring the <tt>canvas</tt> tag the new king of web interaction. I've just stumbled upon <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Rapha&euml;l</a>&mdash;a javascript library for interacting with SVG. The library is cross-browser thanks to VML on Internet Explorer. 

I really like the idea of having real DOM nodes when manipulating things via javascript. The <tt>canvas</tt> tag always seemed a big too much like Flash for my liking. Here are a few of my favorite demos:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://raphaeljs.com/australia.html">A vector map of Australia</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://raphaeljs.com/github/impact.html">Github-style impact chart</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://raphaeljs.com/analytics.html">Interactive analytics graph</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://raphaeljs.com/ichart.html">Draggable graph</a></li>
</ul>

Thanks to <a href="http://pixelmatrixdesign.com/">Josh Pyles</a> for pointing it out.
