I'm incredibly excited to announce my holiday project: the [Middleman Blog Editor](http://middleman-blog-editor.awardwinningfjords.com). This is my first paid extension for [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) and one that I hope will prove that the community is large and mature enough for 3rd-party features and extensions to have become valuable.

Middleman Blog Editor is an extension which uses Middleman Blog to provide a beautiful organizational interface and  WYSIWYG editing. The UI can currently publish/unpublish articles, edit tags, change the article date and URL. Here's what it looks like:
