I'm excited to announce the inaugural Portland Ember.js meetup!

Starts at **7pm** at **Instrument**: [419 NE 10th Ave. Portland, OR 97232](https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&f=d&daddr=Instrument,+419+Northeast+10th+Avenue,+Portland,+OR+97232&geocode=CZ3b9koLUqYZFVGstgIdEGyw-CG_ObMAL6bQkw&gl=US&hl=en)

I'll be giving an introductory talk which will walk-through the creation of a Github Issues app and touch on topics such as: Ember philosophy, views, templates, AJAX and REST APIs.

Not sure if there will be time for Q/A, but feel free to join me immediately after at [Rontoms](http://www.rontoms.net) for yelling, debating and drinking.
