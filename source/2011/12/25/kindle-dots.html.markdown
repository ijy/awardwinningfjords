I used to tear through several books at a time. I'd collect and organize as many as I could get my hands on and keep them in as pristine condition as possible.

My dad loved comics and sci-fi, so I started there. Then, I became interested in pop-science biology and cosmology. In school, I studied computer science and comparative religion. At some point after college, I exhausted the genres I was interested in.

Not having something to read was frustrating, but nothing I picked up would hold my interest. Eventually, I got tired of lugging dozens of boxes of books around and sold them all back to Amazon. 

Last Christmas, I got a 3rd generation Kindle from my wife. Suddenly my library was infinite and accessible anywhere. I started reading the *Song of Ice and Fire* books in preparation for the HBO series and discovered something rather amazing about the Kindle. Because the Kindle allows different font face and size settings, it does keep a page count, rather it shows your relative position in the book with highlighted dots. This means the 1200 page fantasy novel that I would have found daunting and awkward to carry around is suddenly small and portable. The mental weight of all those pages was reduced to "do I want to read the next page."

I read a lot of long books this year, mostly fantasy, some sci-fi and some steampunk. I decided to check Amazon for the actual printed page lengths of these books.
