> About a year ago, we teamed up with <a href="http://www.45royale.com/">45royale</a> to create <a href="http://pixelunion.net">Pixel Union</a>, a premium Tumblr theme marketplace showcasing designs by some of the world’s best designers. It’s been immensely successful. What began as four themes dedicated to better showcasing photographs and videos has rapidly turned into a library of nearly twenty, multipurpose themes. <br /><br />
> It’s with a whole lot of pride that we announce today the launch of Pixel Union 2.0. We’ve redesigned the site, we’ve packed it full of new themes and, over the next two months, we’re going to be releasing one new theme each week. Check out <a href="http://pixelunion.net/">the new site</a> and stay tuned by following Pixel Union <a href="http://twitter.com/pixelunion">on Twitter</a><br /><br />
